# Ether Email-Auth SDK
## Overview
One issue with existing applications on Ethereum is that all users who execute transactions on-chain must install Ethereum-specific tools such as wallets and manage their own private keys.
Our ether email-auth SDK solves this issue: it allows users to execute any transaction on-chain simply by sending an email.

Using the SDK, a developer can build a smart contract with the following features without new ZKP circuits.
1. (Authorization) The contract can authorize any message in the Subject of the email that the user sends with a DKIM signature generated by an email provider, e.g., Gmail. 
2. (Authentication) The contract can authenticate that the given Ethereum address corresponds to the email address in the From field of the email.
3. (Privacy) No on-chain information reveals the user's email address itself. In other words, any adversary who learns only public data cannot get the corresponding email address from the Ethereum address.

One of its killer applications is email-based account recovery, one of social recovery for account abstraction (AA) wallets.
In social recovery, the wallet owner must appoint trusted persons as guardians who are authorized to update the private key to control the wallet.
However, not all such persons are necessarily Ethereum users.
Our solution mitigates this constraint by allowing guardians to complete the recovery process simply by sending an email.
In other words, any trusted persons can work as guardians as long as they can send emails.
Using the ether email-auth SDK, we construct a library and tools for any AA wallet providers to integrate our email-based account recovery just by implementing a few Solidity functions!

## Architecture
In addition to a user and a smart contract employing our SDK, there is a permissionless server called Relayer.
The Relayer connects the off-chain world, where the users are, with the on-chain world, where the contracts reside, without compromising security.
Specifically, the user, the Relayer, and the contract collaborate as follows:
1. (Off-chain) The user sends the Relayer an email containing a message to the contract in the Subject.
2. (Off-chain) The Relayer generates an email-auth message for the given email, consisting of data about the Subject, an Ethereum address corresponding to the user's email address, a ZK proof of the email, and so on.
3. (Off-chain -> On-chain) The Relayer broadcasts an Ethereum transaction to call the contract with the email-auth message.
4. (On-chain) After authorizing and authenticating the given email-auth message, the contract executes application-specific logic depending on the message in the Subject and the user's Ethereum address.
5. (On-chain -> Off-chain) The Relayer sends the user an email to report the execution result of the contract.

## Novel Concepts
### Account Code and Salt
An account code is a random integer in a finite scalar field of BN254 curve. 
It is a private randomness to derive a CREATE2 salt of the user’s Ethereum address from the email address, i.e., `userEtherAddr := CREATE2(hash(userEmailAddr, accountCode))`. 
That CREATE2 salt is called account salt, which is published on-chain.
**As long as the account code is hidden, no adversary can learn the user's email address from on-chain data.** 

### Invitation Code
An invitation code is a hex string of the account code along with a prefix, contained in any field of the email header to be inherited by its reply, e.g., Subject.
By confirming that a user sends an email with the invitation code, the contract can ensure that the account code is available to that user. 
It ensures the user’s liveness even when a malicious relayer or another user generates the user's account code because it prevents them from withholding the account code. 
**It suggests that the contract must check if the given email sent by the user contains the invitation code before confirming that user’s account for the first time.**

Notably, the email-auth message, which represents data in the user's email along with its ZK proof, has a boolean field such that the value is true if the invitation code is in the email.
However, the Subject message in the email-auth message masks characters for the invitation code.
**Consequently, no information beyond the existence of the invitation code is disclosed.**

### Subject Template
A subject template defines the expected format of the message in the Subject for each application.
**It allows developers to constrain that message to be in the application-specific format without new ZKP circuits.**

Specifically, the subject template is an array of strings, each of which has some fixed strings without space and the following variable parts:
- `"{string}"`: a string. Its Solidity type is `string`.
- `"{uint}"`: a decimal string of the unsigned integer. Its Solidity type is `uint256`.
- `"{int}"`: a decimal string of the signed integer. Its Solidity type is `int256`.
- `"{decimals}"`: a decimal string of the decimals. Its Solidity type is `uint256`. Its decimal size is fixed to 18. E.g., “2.7” ⇒ `abi.encode(2.7 * (10**18))`.
- `"{ethAddr}"`: a hex string of the Ethereum address. Its Solidity type is `address`. Its value MUST satisfy the checksum of the Ethereum address.

## How to Develop New Apps
There are four significant packages in this repo:
### `circuits` Package
It has a main circom circuit for verifying the email along with its DKIM signature, revealing a Subject message that masks an email address and an invitation code, and deriving an account salt from the email address in the From field and the given account code, which should match with the invitation code if it exists in the email.
The circuit is agnostic to application contexts such as subject templates.
**Therefore, a developer does not need to make new circuits.**

### `contracts` Package
It has Solidity contracts that help any smart contracts employing our SDK authorize and authenticate the email-auth message. Among them, there are three significant contracts: verifier, DKIM registry, and email-auth contracts.

The verifier contract in `Verifier.sol` has a responsibility to verify the ZK proof in the given email-auth message. 
It is a global contract, that is, multiple users in your application will use the same verifier contract.
You can deploy a new verifier contract once or use the already-deployed contract.

The DKIM registry contract has a responsibility to manage a mapping between an email domain name and its latest public keys used to verify the DKIM signatures. 
It should have mechanisms such that each user or some trusted custodians can rotate and void the registered public keys.
For example, the contract in `ECDSAOwnedDKIMRegistry.sol` requires ECDSA signatures from an owner of the predefined Ethereum address.
If you use the common trusted custodians for all users, you can deploy a new DKIM registry contract once or use the already-deployed contract.
If each user should be able to modify the registered public keys, a new DKIM registry contract needs to be deployed for each user.

The email-auth contract in `EmailAuth.sol` is a contract for each email user.
Its contract Ethereum address is calculated as the CREATE2 of the account salt, i.e., the hash of the user's email address and one account code held by the user. 
It provides an entry function `authEmail` to authorize and authenticate the email-auth message by calling the verifier and the DKIM registry contracts.
Besides, it supports [ERC-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271). 
After the email-auth message is processed in the `authEmail` function, the `isValidSignature` function of the email-auth contract returns true for the hash of the data in the email-auth message and its email nullifier, a 32-byte data unique to each email.

Your application contract can employ those contracts in the following manner:
1. For a new email user, the application contract deploys (a proxy of) the email-auth contract. Subsequently, the application contract sets the addresses of the verifier and the DKIM registry contracts and some subject templates for your application to the email-auth contract.
2. Given a new email-auth message from the email user, the application contract calls the `authEmail` function in the email-auth contract for that user. If it returns no error, the application contract can execute any processes based on the message in the email-auth message.

### `relayer` Package
It has a Rust implementation of the Relayer server.
Unfortunately, the current code only supports an application of the email-based account recovery described later.
We will provide a more generic implementation in the future.

### `prover` Package
It has some scripts for a prover server that generates a proof of the main circuit in the circuits package.
The Relayer calls the prover server for each given email to delegate the proof generation.
You can deploy the prover server either on your local machine or [Modal instances](https://modal.com/).
